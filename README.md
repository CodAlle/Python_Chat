Python_Chat
===========

TO run the chat first have to run the server file:

$ sudo su
$ cd /folder name/
$ python chatserver.py

  after you share the communication.py and chatclient.py files 
with friends or copy to other machine have to run

$ sudo su
$ cd /folder name/
$ python chatclient.py localhost 3490

REMEMBER:
to personalise the username you have to rename the chatclient.py file

AND don't forget to change that also when you run the client.

EX: python rename_chatclient.py localhost 3940
